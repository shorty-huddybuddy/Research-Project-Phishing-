# Analyzing Phishing Techniques Bypassing Spam Detection

This project investigates and categorizes emerging phishing techniques used to bypass spam filters, including spoofing, obfuscation, and dynamic content. It explores social engineering tactics and technical evasion methods employed by phishers, providing insights and analyses to enhance spam detection mechanisms.

## Features

- **Phishing Techniques Analysis**  
  Investigated advanced phishing techniques like spoofing, content obfuscation, and dynamic manipulation.
  
- **Social Engineering Insights**  
  Explored tactics used by phishers to exploit human behavior, enhancing understanding of phishing strategies.

- **Comprehensive Tool Utilization**  
  Leveraged tools and APIs for in-depth analysis:
  - [SpamAssassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org/): An open-source spam filter for email classification.
  - [GoPhish](https://getgophish.com/): A powerful phishing simulation framework.
  - [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/): A lightweight email client for testing and analysis.
  - APIs:
    - [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/): A collaborative clearing house for phishing data.
    - [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/): A service for analyzing files and URLs for viruses and malware.
    - [ZeroBounce](https://www.zerobounce.net/): An email validation service.

## Objectives

- To categorize and understand technical evasion methods employed by phishers.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of spam filters against emerging phishing techniques.
- To provide actionable recommendations to improve spam detection systems.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Gather phishing samples from trusted APIs like PhishTank and VirusTotal.
   
2. **Analysis**  
   Use tools such as SpamAssassin and Mutt to analyze email content, headers, and metadata.
   
3. **Simulation**  
   Simulate phishing attacks with GoPhish to study real-world behaviors.
   
4. **Evaluation**  
   Measure the effectiveness of spam filters against various phishing techniques.

## Results

- Detailed categorization of phishing techniques bypassing spam filters.
- Identification of weaknesses in current spam detection mechanisms.
- Insights into improving spam filtering algorithms and policies.
